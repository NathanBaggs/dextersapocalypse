      <h1>Week 1: The Village</h1>
      <h3>Steven Brown's debut novel is a very British take on the apocalypse.</h3>
      <p>When Dexter, who has just lost his home and his job, arrives back in the village where he grew up as a child he just wants to collect his inheritance and fly somewhere warm. He wakes up one autumn morning to find a deadly virus which turns ordinary people into flesh-eating killers has spread across the country and has reached the village. His mysterious grandfather Josiah's genes seem to alter the virus's effects, and when Dexter is bitten and becomes infected he finds that he has never felt better. Teaming up with his long-lost cousins, Dex finds himself fighting to save his home against a pack of infected hunters preying on the people of the village. The cousin's immunity, however, doesn't go unnoticed and attracts the attention of those still holding onto power. As well as fighting off the infected, Dexter ends up struggling to save his family and in the process unwittingly makes an enemy of the leader of the free world. Just who was Josiah Ellerby? Why have the Americans invaded North Wales? Will Dexters pet zombie Lottie really eat chicken? And will Dexter ever take anything seriously again?</p><br>

     <h1>Week 2 - The Wild West</h1>
     <p>Follow the further adventures of Dexter and his cousins in a crazy second week where they barely have time to fit in a rare steak and pint of locally sourced, sustainably produced beer. Dexter meets his cannibalistic cousin Lexi who has to leave the Birmingham Safe Zone in a hurry due to her appetite for human flesh. Lexi joins her cousins as they go on a quest to find a weapon to help the U.S. Marines overthrow the new white supremacist regime on Anglesea in Wales. Jordan runs off with Marine Johnson in a move to assassinate the President. The villagers agree to trade a shipment of food to the city of Birmingham in exchange for three hours of electricity including television broadcasts each day. The cousins help make the delivery and then go on to raid a government installation in a bid to uncover the truth about their grandfather's involvement in Project Eddas. They learn more about their apparent resistance to the virus and how their new powers work and begin to unravel the mystery of who is behind the release of the virus. Dexter’s pet zombie Lottie also makes a reappearance, unwittingly doing her part to take down the evil regime and we finally meet the Reverend Jonathan Stephens, an intelligent infected who is gathering his flock for an attack on the village.</p>

<p>The fights are getting bigger, the violence continues to escalate and the antics of Dexter and his cousins just gets more hilarious as they continue to navigate their new post-apocalyptic environment. Will Dexter and his cousins manage to find the weapon in time? Can they get the food delivery through to Birmingham? Will the mysterious Manager wipe out the village with his infected horde? Did Dexter accidentally eat Emma's brother Dave? And will Emma ever forgive Dexter and agree to go on a second date with him? Find out in this action-packed second instalment of Dexter’s Apocalypse.</p><br>
